if custom link is given and it already exists in the db then primary key error

ulid id can be used as shortened url

ulids have similar starting characters and alphanumeric numeric unique values

even uuids are alphanumeric so cannot use both uuid and ulid

for better computing generate random short url on client side and send it to server
