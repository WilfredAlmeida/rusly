## Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Rusly. It's people like you that make Rusly such a great tool.

**Note**: Please open an issue or discussion to discuss about your component and then you can proceed.

### You have found a bug

Please open an issue with the label `bug`. To clearly explain the bug, describe it in as much detail as possible. A bug issue must compulsorily have the steps-to-reproduce

### You are requesting a new feature

Please open an issue with the label `feature-request` and include as much information as you can about the need for the feature. The maintainers will convert it into a discussion if needed.

### You want to contact the maintainers

### Commits

Please keep commits modular. One big commit or commits with many files and breaking changes will be hard to understand and maintain and might lead to rejection of the contribution.
